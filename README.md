# DrunkAlien
This game was created by Liubov Piliagina to show the basic skills of programming in the C #  language and the ability to work with the Unity engine (created for not commercial purpose).

You're an alien who had collected cows for scientific research and after work decided to drink a little...
Goal is to get to the takeoff point and not lose cows!
